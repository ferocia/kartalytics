#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
vendor/bundle/

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep

/public/assets
.byebug_history
